Little project to learn more about Qt GUI library and also practice/learn a bit of MVVM-style coding.

The idea was to create a very minimalist plasmid editor for DNA work without unnecessary extras. Unlikely to ever be finished as I'm just using it as a platform for learning.

An example of what it currently looks like (Feb 2019) is found here - [YAPE](http://kruusv.ee/images/yape.png)
